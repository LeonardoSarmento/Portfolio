### Implementing Dynamic Routing and State Management with React and TypeScript

#### Introduction

Dynamic routing and state management are crucial elements for building efficient interfaces in modern web applications. By using tools such as `TanStack Router`, `TanStack Query`, `TypeScript`, `React`, and `Vite.js`, we can create a highly performant and flexible application. In this post, I’ll share how to configure these tools to build a robust solution that combines dynamic routing and asynchronous data management in a scalable and strongly typed way.

#### My Dynamic Routing and State Management Project

Recently, I developed a project that uses **Vite** as the bundler, **React** for the interface, and **TanStack Router** for dynamic routing. Additionally, I implemented **TanStack Query** to manage asynchronous states and data caching, ensuring the application runs smoothly and optimally. Strong typing with **TypeScript** was key to ensuring code safety and consistency, making long-term maintenance much easier.

#### Advantages of Implementing with These Tools

- **`TanStack Router`**: Allows for the creation of dynamic routes in a flexible and declarative way, generating URLs based on real-time data.

- **`TanStack Query`**: Simplifies the management of asynchronous data, such as API requests, with intelligent caching and automatic revalidation.

- **`TypeScript`**: Provides static typing that helps avoid errors and improves code readability.

- **`Vite.js`**: Offers a fast and efficient development environment and optimizes the build for high-performance in production.

#### Key Reasons to Use These Tools

1. **Flexibility**: TanStack Router allows for easy dynamic routing, adapting the application's navigation in real-time.

2. **Efficient State Management**: TanStack Query provides advanced cache management, optimizing data fetching from APIs and ensuring superior performance.

3. **Safety with Typing**: The combination with TypeScript ensures consistency and reduces the likelihood of errors, especially in larger projects.

4. **Fast Development**: Vite.js speeds up development with instant builds and real-time page updates, optimizing the development experience.

#### Try It Out

Check out the project I developed, [Dynamic Routing with TanStack Router](https://routing.leosarmento.com), where you can find a detailed tutorial on configuring dynamic routing and practical examples of how to integrate TanStack Query to manage states with asynchronous data. This combination of tools is perfect for developers looking to build high-performance, scalable React applications.
