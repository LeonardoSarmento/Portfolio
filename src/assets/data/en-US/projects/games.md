# Creating a Games with TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and Motion

## Introduction

Building interactive games on the web is not only fun but also a great way to showcase skills in modern web development. With **TypeScript**, **shadcn/ui**, and **motion**, I created an animated **Games**. This platform includes a collection of classic and modern games like **2048**, **Hangman**, **Minesweeper**, **Snake**, **Sudoku**, **Tic Tac Toe**, and **Wordle**. In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the development process, the technologies used, and the highlights of the platform.

## My Games Project

The **Games** is a project designed to demonstrate how web technologies can bring games to life with smooth animations and dynamic routing. Utilizing **TanStack Router**, each game is accessible via dedicated routes, creating a seamless navigation experience. The combination of **TypeScript**, **motion**, and **shadcn/ui** ensures a highly polished and performant user interface.

## Libraries Used in This Project

To develop the Games, I used the following tools and libraries:

- **`TypeScript`**: For strong typing and maintaining code reliability.
- **`React`**: The foundation for building reusable and interactive components.
- **`TanStack Router`**: A modern routing solution for managing game-specific routes.
- **`motion`**: For adding engaging animations to the user interface.
- **`shadcn/ui`**: A library for building clean and consistent UI components.
- **`Tailwind CSS`**: For rapid styling with a utility-first approach.
- **`Vite`**: A fast build tool that speeds up development.

## Benefits of Using These Tools

1. **Dynamic Routing**:  
   Using **TanStack Router**, each game has its own dedicated route, making navigation smooth and intuitive.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**:  
   **motion** enables smooth transitions and animations, creating a delightful experience.
3. **Clean UI**:  
   **shadcn/ui** and **Tailwind CSS** simplify building a consistent and responsive design.
4. **Scalable Codebase**:  
   **TypeScript** ensures that the code is maintainable and less prone to errors.

## Key Features of the Platform

- **Interactive Games**: Seven games, each with unique logic and animations.
- **Seamless Navigation**: Navigate between games effortlessly with **TanStack Router**.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Engaging Animations**: Animations powered by **motion** add a modern touch to the interface.

## Conclusion

The Games combines the power of **TypeScript**, **motion**, **shadcn/ui**, and **TanStack Router** to deliver a collection of interactive games with a sleek and polished user experience. This project highlights the potential of modern web development tools in creating engaging and scalable applications.
