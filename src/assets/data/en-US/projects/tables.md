### Implementing a Data Table with Dynamic Filters

#### Introduction

In modern web applications, tables with dynamic filters, pagination, and sorting are essential for presenting large datasets in a user-friendly way. Using a combination of tools like **TanStack Table**, **TanStack Router**, **TanStack Query**, and **Shadcn/UI**, we can create a powerful and interactive **Data Table** that allows users to filter, sort, and paginate through data efficiently. In this post, I will guide you through implementing a complete Data Table with dynamic filters, using mock data and managing filters via URL parameters for a seamless experience.

#### My Data Table Project with Dynamic Filters

Recently, I built a project that uses **TanStack Table** for creating a highly customizable data table, **TanStack Query** for fetching and managing asynchronous data, and **TanStack Router** for handling routing and URL parameters. Additionally, I incorporated **Shadcn/UI** to design a clean and responsive user interface. This project is designed to showcase how to implement a fully functional Data Table with dynamic filters and pagination while keeping the UI polished and easy to use.

#### Libraries Used in This Project

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following libraries installed in your project:

- **`TypeScript`**: For strong static typing and code reliability.
- **`React`**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **`Vite`**: A fast and efficient build tool for web development.
- **`TanStack Query`**: For managing asynchronous data with caching and revalidation.
- **`TanStack Router`**: A modern routing solution for React.
- **`TanStack Table`**: A highly customizable library for building data tables.
- **`Zod`**: For TypeScript-based data validation.
- **`Shadcn/UI`**: A collection of ready-made UI components for designing interfaces.

#### Benefits of Using These Tools

- **`TanStack Table`**: Provides powerful table functionalities like sorting, filtering, and pagination, with full flexibility for customization.
- **`TanStack Query`**: Simplifies data fetching and caching, ensuring a smooth and efficient data management experience.
- **`TanStack Router`**: Allows for dynamic routing and filter management via URL parameters, improving the user experience and state management.
- **`Shadcn/UI`**: Offers pre-built components that make designing responsive and user-friendly interfaces fast and efficient.

#### Key Reasons to Use These Tools

1. **Dynamic Filtering**: With **TanStack Router** and URL parameters, users can easily filter data and preserve filter states across sessions.
2. **Efficient Data Fetching**: **TanStack Query** ensures smooth data fetching, caching, and revalidation for large datasets.
3. **Customizable Data Table**: **TanStack Table** provides flexibility for building advanced tables with features like sorting, pagination, and dynamic filtering.
4. **Responsive and User-Friendly UI**: **Shadcn/UI** components make it easy to design an attractive and responsive user interface.

#### Conclusion

By using **TanStack Table**, **TanStack Query**, **TanStack Router**, and **Shadcn/UI**, weâ€™ve created a robust and dynamic data table that can handle large datasets with filters, pagination, and sorting. This combination of tools ensures both flexibility and performance, while also providing a smooth and interactive user experience.
