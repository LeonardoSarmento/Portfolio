# Front-End Application Template with TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS

## Introduction

Building a front-end application quickly and efficiently is a common need in many modern projects. In this post, Iâ€™ll share with you a template that simplifies the creation of scalable and easy-to-maintain front-end applications. By utilizing **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and several other technologies, this template provides a solid foundation to start developing a new application with ready-to-use features.

## My Project: Front-End Application Template

The template I developed offers a set of useful features for quickly building applications with **TypeScript** and **Vite**. The project is structured to include components such as a **Sidebar**, **Data Table**, **Calendar**, **Form Validation**, and more. Additionally, it uses technologies like **@tanstack/query** for asynchronous state management, **react-hook-form** for forms, and **zod** for type validation, providing a robust and scalable approach for front-end projects.

## Libraries Used in the Project

To build the template, I used the following tools and libraries:

- **`TypeScript`** (~5.6.2): To ensure strong typing and reliability in the code.
- **`Vite`** (^5.4.9): A fast and modern build tool for front-end applications.
- **`@tanstack/router-plugin`** (^1.79.0): A robust, type-safe router for error-free navigation.
- **`@tanstack/query`** (^5.59.16): To simplify asynchronous state management and API requests.
- **`recharts`** (^2.13.0): A library for data visualization with interactive charts.
- **`react-hook-form`** (^7.53.1): Simplifies form management efficiently and effortlessly.
- **`zod`** (^3.23.8): For strong and safe data validation.
- **`tailwindcss`** (^3.4.14): A utility-first CSS framework for agile development and responsive designs.

### Development Tools:

- **`eslint`** (^9.13.0): To ensure code quality and consistent coding standards.
- **`prettier`** (^3.3.3): A code formatting tool that helps keep the style consistent.

## Benefits of Using These Tools

1. **Fast and Efficient Development**:  
   **Vite** provides an extremely fast development experience with instant reloading and built-in support for TypeScript.
2. **Simple and Efficient State Management**:  
   **@tanstack/query** simplifies asynchronous state management with automatic data synchronization between the client and server.

3. **Safe Data Validation**:  
   **Zod** ensures safe and robust data validations, preventing runtime errors.

4. **Responsive and Customizable Interface**:  
   **TailwindCSS** enables you to quickly build responsive and customizable designs with minimal effort, while keeping the code clean and easy to maintain.

## Key Features of the Template

- **Sidebar**: A responsive sidebar for quick navigation between pages.
- **Data Table**: A flexible table component with support for filtering and pagination.
- **Calendar**: An interactive calendar component for scheduling and viewing events.
- **Form Validation**: Using **react-hook-form** and **zod** to ensure safe and efficient data input.
- **Interactive Charts**: Data visualization with **recharts** to create dynamic charts.
- **URL Search Params**: Efficient management of URL parameters for data filtering.
- **State Management**: With **@tanstack/query** to ensure data is always up-to-date and synchronized.

## How to Use the Template

To integrate the template into your project, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeonardoSarmento/all-around-front.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd all-around-front
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Explore the template, including the sidebar, data table, and calendar.

## Conclusion

This template was designed to provide a solid and modern foundation for any front-end application, with ready-to-use features that are easy to customize. It simplifies development, ensuring clean and scalable code with the help of powerful tools like **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **@tanstack/router**, **Shadcn/ui**, and **TailwindCSS**.
