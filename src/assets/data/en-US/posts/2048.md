## Building a 2048 Game in TypeScript

Creating games is a fantastic way to learn new technologies and demonstrate your skills. In this post, I want to share my experience building a 2048 game using TypeScript, React, and Framer Motion for animations. This project challenged me to work with algorithms, state management, and visual effects in a dynamic and interactive way.

### Overview of the 2048 Game

The 2048 game is a single-player puzzle game where the goal is to combine tiles with the same value to reach the number 2048. The player can use the arrow keys to move tiles in four directions, and new tiles spawn on the grid after each move.

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Grid Management:**

   - The game board is a 4x4 grid that dynamically updates as tiles are moved and combined.
   - Tiles are added to random empty cells after each move.

2. **Score System:**

   - Points are awarded when two tiles merge, and the score is updated accordingly.

3. **Smooth Animations:**

   - Using Framer Motion, animations are applied to tile movements and appearances, enhancing the visual experience.

4. **Keyboard Controls:**

   - The game listens to `keydown` events for arrow key inputs to handle tile movements.

5. **Restart Option:**
   - A restart button resets the grid and score for a new game session.

### The Development Process

#### Initializing the Grid

The grid is initialized with two random tiles:

```typescript
const initializeGrid = (): number[][] => {
  const newGrid = Array.from({ length: 4 }, () => Array(4).fill(0));
  addRandomTile(newGrid);
  addRandomTile(newGrid);
  return newGrid;
};
```

#### Adding Random Tiles

New tiles (2 or 4) are added to random empty cells after each move:

```typescript
function addRandomTile(grid: number[][]): void {
  const emptyCells: [number, number][] = [];

  grid.forEach((row, rowIndex) => {
    row.forEach((cell, colIndex) => {
      if (cell === 0) emptyCells.push([rowIndex, colIndex]);
    });
  });

  if (emptyCells.length > 0) {
    const [row, col] = emptyCells[Math.floor(Math.random() * emptyCells.length)];
    grid[row][col] = Math.random() < 0.9 ? 2 : 4;
  }
}
```

#### Handling Tile Movements

The logic for moving tiles is implemented for all directions (left, right, up, down):

```typescript
const moveLeft = (grid: number[][], tempScore: number): number => {
  for (let row = 0; row < 4; row++) {
    const filteredRow = grid[row].filter((num) => num !== 0);
    for (let col = 0; col < filteredRow.length - 1; col++) {
      if (filteredRow[col] === filteredRow[col + 1]) {
        filteredRow[col] *= 2;
        tempScore += filteredRow[col];
        filteredRow.splice(col + 1, 1);
      }
    }
    grid[row] = [...filteredRow, ...Array(4 - filteredRow.length).fill(0)];
  }
  return tempScore;
};
```

#### Animating the Game

Framer Motion is used to add animations for tile movements and appearances. For example:

```jsx
<motion.div
  key={index}
  className={`flex h-24 w-24 items-center justify-center rounded-lg bg-tile-${cell}`}
  initial={{ scale: 0.8, opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
>
  {cell !== 0 && (
    <motion.span
      className="text-3xl font-bold"
      initial={{ scale: 0.5, opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
    >
      {cell}
    </motion.span>
  )}
</motion.div>
```

#### Listening for Keyboard Inputs

The game listens for keyboard events to handle user inputs:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (['ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown', 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight'].includes(event.key)) {
      handleMove(event.key);
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
}, [handleMove]);
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **State Management:** Managing a dynamic grid and score required careful planning and efficient state updates.
2. **Animations:** Framer Motion made it easy to create smooth animations and improve user experience.
3. **Game Logic:** Implementing tile merging and movement logic was a rewarding algorithmic challenge.

### Future Improvements

- Adding a "Game Over" state.
- Supporting touch gestures for mobile devices.
- Enhancing visuals with custom styles and themes.
