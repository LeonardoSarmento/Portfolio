# Building a Fun Wordle Clone with React, TypeScript, and Motion

Creating a Wordle clone is a fun way to test your React, TypeScript, and animation skills. In this post, I'll walk you through building a fully-featured Wordle game using React, TypeScript, and libraries like `motion` from Framer Motion, `shadcn/ui` for components, and `faker` for generating random words.

This project is a great exercise in managing game state, handling user input, and creating smooth UI transitions. Letâ€™s dive into the code and its functionalities.

## 1. **Setting Up the Game Structure**

We start by defining the core structure of our game:

- **Word to Guess**: A random 5-letter word generated at the start of the game.
- **User Guesses**: The player will try to guess the word, with a limited number of attempts (6 guesses).
- **Game State**: We manage the game state with variables like `word`, `attempts`, `currentGuess`, and `isGameOver` to track the playerâ€™s progress.

## 2. **State Management**

The game heavily relies on React state to track key elements:

- `word`: The secret word to be guessed, randomly generated at the start.
- `attempts`: Stores the guesses made by the player so far.
- `currentGuess`: The player's ongoing guess.
- `isGameOver` & `isGameWon`: Flags to determine if the game is over or won.
- `letterHistory`: Keeps track of the status of each letter (correct, incorrect, or misplaced).
- `guessHistory`: Stores the result of each guess (green, yellow, red).

Hereâ€™s how the state is managed using Reactâ€™s `useState` hook:

```typescript
const [word, setWord] = useState(generateRandomWord());
const [attempts, setAttempts] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [currentGuess, setCurrentGuess] = useState<string>('');
const [isGameOver, setIsGameOver] = useState(false);
const [isGameWon, setIsGameWon] = useState(false);
const [letterHistory, setLetterHistory] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});
const [guessHistory, setGuessHistory] = useState<string[][]>([]);
```

## 3. **Handling User Input**

The game listens for keyboard input to manage guesses. We handle three types of input:

- **Letter keys**: Adds a letter to the `currentGuess` if the player hasnâ€™t yet guessed all the letters.
- **Backspace**: Deletes the last character from the `currentGuess`.
- **Enter**: Submits the current guess and triggers the evaluation.

Hereâ€™s how the keyboard input is managed:

```typescript
const handleKeyDown = useCallback(
  (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (isGameOver || isGameWon) return;

    if (event.key === 'Enter' && currentGuess.length === wordLength) {
      setAttempts((prev) => [...prev, currentGuess]);
      evaluateGuess(currentGuess);
      setCurrentGuess('');
    } else if (event.key === 'Backspace') {
      setCurrentGuess((prev) => prev.slice(0, -1));
    } else if (/^[a-zA-Z]$/.test(event.key) && currentGuess.length < wordLength) {
      setCurrentGuess((prev) => prev + event.key.toLowerCase());
    }
  },
  [currentGuess, isGameOver, isGameWon],
);
```

## 4. **Guess Evaluation Logic**

Each time the user submits a guess, we evaluate it based on the following rules:

- **Green**: The letter is correct and in the correct position.
- **Yellow**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Red**: The letter is not in the word.

Hereâ€™s how we evaluate each guess:

```typescript
const updateGuessHistory = (guess: string) => {
  const wordArr = word.split('');
  const guessArr = guess.split('');
  const remainingLetters: (string | null)[] = [...wordArr];

  const guessResult = Array(wordLength).fill('');

  guessArr.forEach((letter, index) => {
    if (wordArr[index] === letter) {
      guessResult[index] = 'green';
      remainingLetters[index] = null;
    }
  });

  guessArr.forEach((letter, index) => {
    if (guessResult[index] !== 'green') {
      const letterIndex = remainingLetters.indexOf(letter);
      if (letterIndex !== -1) {
        guessResult[index] = 'yellow';
        remainingLetters[letterIndex] = null;
      } else {
        guessResult[index] = 'red';
      }
    }
  });

  setGuessHistory((prev) => [...prev, guessResult]);
  setLetterHistory((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    ...guessResult.reduce(
      (acc, color, idx) => {
        acc[guessArr[idx]] = color;
        return acc;
      },
      {} as Record<string, string>,
    ),
  }));
};
```

## 5. **Animating UI with Framer Motion**

To enhance the user experience, we use `motion` components from Framer Motion to animate the UI. For instance, each letter tile in the grid has a smooth animation when itâ€™s revealed, scaling in from a smaller size to the full size.

Hereâ€™s how the animation is applied to each guess:

```typescript
<motion.div
  key={letterIndex}
  className={`flex h-14 w-14 items-center justify-center rounded-lg border border-primary text-xl font-bold ${tileColor}`}
  initial={{ scale: 0.8, opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
>
  {letter.toUpperCase()}
</motion.div>
```

We use similar animations for displaying the win or loss messages after the game ends, with text appearing smoothly to give feedback to the player.

## 6. **Rendering the Virtual Keyboard**

The virtual keyboard is made of buttons for each letter of the alphabet. When a player clicks on a letter, itâ€™s added to the `currentGuess`. The button colors change dynamically based on the status of the letter (green, yellow, red).

Hereâ€™s the code for rendering the keyboard:

```typescript
<Button
  key={letter}
  disabled={isGameOver || isGameWon}
  className={`rounded-md px-4 py-2 ${letterColor}`}
  onClick={handleClick}
>
  {letter.toUpperCase()}
</Button>
```

## 7. **Game Reset and Restart**

To allow players to play multiple rounds, weâ€™ve included a `resetGame` function that resets all relevant game state variables, generates a new word, and prepares the game for another round. It also ensures the game interface is ready for the new round.

```typescript
const resetGame = () => {
  setWord(generateRandomWord());
  setAttempts([]);
  setCurrentGuess('');
  setIsGameOver(false);
  setIsGameWon(false);
  setLetterHistory({});
  setGuessHistory([]);
};
```

## 8. **Final Display (Win or Loss)**

At the end of each game, we display a message indicating whether the player won or lost. If the game is won, the message is styled with a green color; if the game is lost, itâ€™s red.

```typescript
{isGameOver && (
  <motion.p
    className="mx-20 text-2xl font-bold text-red-600"
    initial={{ scale: 0.8, opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
  >
    Game Over! The word was "{word.toUpperCase()}".
  </motion.p>
)}

{isGameWon && (
  <motion.p
    className="mx-16 text-2xl font-bold text-green-600"
    initial={{ scale: 0.8, opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
  >
    Congratulations! You guessed the word!
  </motion.p>
)}
```

## Conclusion
